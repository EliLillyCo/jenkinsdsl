# Contributing to DSL Core

Thanks for checking out the DSL Core! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will 
benefit others who read and use these Libraries.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Table of Contents
1. [Types of contributions we are looking for](#types-of-contributions-we-are-looking-for)
1. [Ground rules & expectations](#ground-rules--expectations)

## Types of contributions we are looking for
There are many ways you can directly contribute to the guides:

* New features
* Code enhancements
* Bug fixes
* Code readability improvements
* Fix editorial inconsistencies or inaccuracies

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and 
projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others 
rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you 
will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* We will be running dependency and static analysis checks for security issues.
* We expect to have the changes thoroughly unit tested
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or 
your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/CIRR_DSL_Core/issues) 
and [pull requests](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/CIRR_DSL_Core/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a 
similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can 
weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Style guide
We donâ€™t run any hard linting on this project at this time but we expect your style to match what we already have in place. 
Read through some of our code and README.md to ensure that you are following a similar practice.
