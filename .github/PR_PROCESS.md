# How to Submit a Pull Request

Thanks for checking out the DSL Core! We're excited to learn of your interest in submitting a pull request. Your contribution will benefit others who read and use these Libraries.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you determine how best to create and submit a pull request to the codebase.

## Prerequisites

* A __feature/\*__  or  __bug/\*__  branch has been created from the __develop__ branch.
* All the work has been completed in the feature (or bug) branch, including unit tests.
* The changelog has been updated with information on what has been changed in the feature branch.
* The developer is prepared to create a pull request from the feature branch into the __develop__ branch.

## Create Pull Request

The developer will create and submit a pull request by following these guidelines.

* Click the create pull request link on GitHub.
* Attach self as assignee on the pull request.
* Write a description in the pull request template of what the pull request contributes to the codebase, stating what is being proposed/changed.
* Complete the remaining sections of the pull request template and submit the pull request.

The pull request will be reviewed by two or more reviewers from the DSL Core team.

* Before running our automated test environment, the code will be initially examined for basic validity. If the proposed change is determined to be acceptable, then the full end-to-end testing environment will be run.
* If fixes or other code changes are needed, the reviewer will ask the developer to address them.
* If new security vulnerabilities have been introduced, the reviewer will make an informed decision regarding the pull request.
* The reviewer can provide additional feedback; and if feedback is given, it is the responsibility of the developer to work through them.
* Once two reviewers have approved the code, the pull request can be approved and merged into the target branch.
